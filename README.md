# Advent of Code 2024

This project contains all my code for the 2024 Advent of Code challenges.

README generated with ChatGPT, my code is not :)

## Overview

Advent of Code is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 edition.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained within its own directory, named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01` for December 1st).

## Running the Code

To run the code for a specific day, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory.
